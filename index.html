For this game, I wanted to try and convey the 
        <br>  

feelings of being alone at home and not having 
        <br>  

much to do, or having much you want to do. I tried
        <br>  

to accomplish this by giving the player a lot of 
        <br>  

looping options to chose from, many of which result 
        <br>  

in a wasted day where they feel bad. As I was wokring,
        <br>  

however, I started having a lot of fun, and I added
        <br>  

in a few extra endings and routes that act as fun
        <br>  
little secrets for those who find them
